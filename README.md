# webpack-cli [WIP]

`webpack-cli` is the main cli package for webpack module bundler.


# Roadmap to the first release

- Migrate to webpack-cli all the current cli options available in webpack-cli
- Create a `webpack-cli init` command that serves to set a configuration of webpack to the user
- create a `webpack-cli migrate` command that serves to migrate an existing configuration from webpack 1 to webpack 2.
